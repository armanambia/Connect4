# Connect4

This project is a connect 4 implementation using python lists. The connect4.py file contains a version of the game that can be played in the python console. The connect4GUI.py
file uses the algorithms created in the previous file but re-designed as a GUI and programmed using pygame. Lastly the connect4GUI.exe file is an executable file created from the
connect4GUI.py and can be downloaded to run the game directly.
